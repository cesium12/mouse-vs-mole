Notes - 9/17 - High Level Game Mechanics

Block destruction / resources:
-should be able to change amount of time it takes to destroy a block, to speed up or slow down game
-resources should not be present in all blocks, but in certain blocks, and are "dropped" when blocks are destroyed
	-must walk over resource to collect
	-forces players to run around map
-blocks don't fall

Game field:
-should be able to change size of game map
-should be able to change # of block colors used (or size of clusters, depending on algorithm)
-5 minute time limit, be changeable if we decide game should run for more or less time

Art assets:
-largest at 40x40px, scale down to 20x20, scale down further if necessary
-stretch goal: allow borders to be added to blocks depending on whether they are adjacent to another block of the same color, or a differently-colored block (make clusters look more smooth and borders between clusters more visible)

Player actions:
-player is allowed to jump
-player holds down a key to do break blocks in the direction they're facing/walking
-if a block is immediately above player, player can continuously pick at it without stopping because they're "too low", and they don't need to jump to hit the block
